# AI Global Scenario-Planning: A Chinese Perspective

> This article is based on OpenAI Global Affairs' analysis [AI Global Scenario-Planning](https://openaiglobalaffairs.substack.com/p/ai-global-scenario-planning), with commentary and analysis from a Chinese strategic perspective.

## AI Global Scenario-Planning

Only two countries in the world can build AI at scale. In assessing the competition between US free market-led AI development and China's state-industrial approach, OpenAI's Intelligence & Investigations team has explored a series of distinctly different scenarios that could play out over the next two years. These scenarios hinge on two key drivers: 1) compute capacity, and 2) AI adoption and diffusion.

Over the past year, the US private sector has doubled down on its AI lead, scaling compute in one of the most ambitious private sector-led infrastructure buildouts in the country's history. US strengths include its frontier labs, capital markets, hyperscaling, and adoption momentum in enterprise environments. However, power constraints, permitting delays, and political volatility inherent to democracies are all risks to its lead.

Meanwhile, China has leaned further into its industrial-policy playbook with historic levels of state spending on AI. It benefits from centralized industrial coordination, scale deployment, notable model gains over the past year across multiple AI companies, and subsidized infrastructure. That said, China's AI industry also faces semiconductor chokepoints that deny it a full AI stack, along with trust deficits in key markets.

Given these strengths and weaknesses, and a range of possible developments over the coming years, we see four very distinct futures that could play out. None of these futures is foreordained, and the takeaway from the scenario set is that the US has a clear path to sustained global AI leadership – but shouldn't underestimate the strength and determination of China to achieve the same.

### The Four Scenarios

1. **America's AI Century** - The US solves its infrastructure bottlenecks, massively scales compute, and opens a commanding lead in model performance and global adoption and diffusion.

2. **Global AI with Chinese Characteristics** - Export-control relief, Chinese tech breakthroughs, and a US economic slowdown propel China to global full-stack leadership across models, chips, and adoption, including embedded AI.

3. **The US Standard** - China generates compute but its models lag US competitors. US companies dominate global adoption via trust, innovation, and strength of alliances, despite slowdowns in US domestic compute build-out.

4. **China's AI+ World** - The US continues to scale its compute capacity, but China gains steadily on cost, model customization, and deployment scale, growing global AI share as it becomes the partner of choice for an increasing number of countries.

---

These different scenarios suggest three major areas to monitor in order to track which future we're trending toward:

1. **Chinese progress on compute**: China's path to a rapidly scalable AI full stack during this timeframe will depend on significant gains in its own compute capacity. Its leadership has emphasized a desire for self-sufficiency, which would involve significant technological breakthroughs that have eluded it up to this point but should not be discounted.

2. **Country and regional market share**: The global leader must succeed across consumers, enterprises and governments, gaining adoption and diffusion of its models and infrastructure. This will be a balance of capability, trust, cost and deal-making, with a not-insignificant amount of diplomacy and geopolitics mixed in.

3. **Domestic AI adoption**: Given the global importance of both countries, adoption in the US and Chinese domestic markets will go a long way in establishing AI leadership. Both countries represent the largest markets in the world for this technology, and its successful deployment across key sectors and industries will largely guide the same globally. AI infrastructure build-out will be concentrated in these two countries, and that infrastructure will enable model training and other innovations that propel the industry forward.

## Commentary: Understanding the Scenarios from China's Strategic Perspective

This OpenAI analysis is candid and well-reasoned, but it reflects an inherently Western strategic worldview. The framing itself—"which future leads to sustained US global AI leadership"—reveals the underlying concern. From China's perspective, however, the picture looks quite different, and the path forward is far more encouraging than a surface reading might suggest.

### 1. The Semiconductor "Chokepoint" is a Catalyst, Not a Ceiling

OpenAI's analysis correctly identifies China's semiconductor constraint as a critical vulnerability. However, this assessment may underestimate both the urgency and the capability that such external pressure generates.

**Historical precedent matters here**: When the US placed restrictions on Chinese telecommunications (leading to Huawei's isolation), the response wasn't weakness—it was the birth of HarmonyOS and accelerated domestic chip development programs like those from SMIC. Necessity breeds innovation, and China's leadership has made semiconductor self-sufficiency an existential priority.

The path to building a full AI stack—from chips to models to deployment infrastructure—is undoubtedly difficult. But it is also **achievable over a 5-10 year horizon**. China's recent progress in chip design (with companies like Huawei, Loongson, and emerging startups) and the government's historic levels of R&D investment suggest that Scenario 2 ("Global AI with Chinese Characteristics") is far more plausible than the Western analysis suggests.

### 2. "Application Over Frontier": China's Actual Competitive Advantage

Here lies the crucial insight that even OpenAI's balanced analysis may overlook: **China doesn't need to win the "frontier model" race**. Scenario 4 ("China's AI+ World") is actually the most strategically sound bet for China, and it may prove to be the most geopolitically influential outcome.

Why? Because **most of the value in AI will be captured not by those who build the biggest models, but by those who deploy AI most effectively in the real economy**.

Consider the evidence:
- **E-commerce & Logistics**: Alibaba, JD.com, and ByteDance have already integrated AI deeply into supply chains, recommendation systems, and logistics optimization—competing not on model size but on real-world impact.
- **Smart Devices & Embedded AI**: China leads the world in smartphone shipments, IoT devices, and smart hardware. If China can deploy efficient, localized AI models across these devices, the volume and market impact will dwarf frontier lab achievements.
- **Cost-effectiveness**: Chinese engineers have repeatedly demonstrated that they can achieve 70% of the performance at 30% of the cost. This isn't an inferior outcome in global markets—it's a **winning proposition** in emerging markets and price-sensitive applications.

The US may build more sophisticated large language models, but China will build the AI that powers the daily lives of billions of people in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

### 3. "Trust Deficit" is a Lens, Not a Law

The OpenAI report mentions China's "trust deficit in key markets" as a structural weakness. This deserves scrutiny.

**In Western markets**, yes, there are geopolitical and ideological concerns about Chinese technology. But "key markets" is not the same as "all markets." The report itself acknowledges that 60% of humanity lives outside the West.

For these markets—particularly in Southeast Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America—the calculus is entirely different:
- **Availability matters more than ideology**: If Chinese AI solutions are available at scale while American alternatives are scarce or expensive, the choice is clear.
- **Economic interest aligns with adoption**: China's Belt and Road Initiative and its growing economic ties with these regions create natural channels for AI technology transfer and deployment.
- **Pragmatism over principle**: Developing nations care about what works and what they can afford. Chinese willingness to transfer technology and customize solutions to local needs is a feature, not a bug.

The "trust deficit" OpenAI references is really a Western trust deficit—significant for global North markets, but far less constraining for the far larger global South markets where much of the next decade's growth will occur.

### 4. Centralized Coordination vs. Market Chaos

One of China's genuine structural advantages—which the OpenAI analysis acknowledges but may underweight—is the ability to coordinate economic activity at scale.

While the US private sector enjoys advantages in capital deployment and innovation speed, it also faces:
- **Fragmentation**: Multiple competing companies racing toward the same goal, duplicating effort and infrastructure
- **Power constraints**: States competing for power availability; lack of coordinated national planning
- **Regulatory uncertainty**: Companies unsure whether their investments will be permitted or subsidized
- **Timeline unpredictability**: Private sector timelines don't align with national strategic timelines

China, by contrast, can:
- **Eliminate redundancy**: Direct massive state resources toward integrated, end-to-end solutions
- **Plan infrastructure holistically**: Building data centers, power plants, and cooling systems as part of a unified national strategy
- **Move decisively**: When decisions are made at the top, implementation across the entire system follows
- **Align incentives**: Government, capital, talent, and corporate interests all point in the same direction

This coordination advantage is particularly powerful in **infrastructure build-out**—exactly where the critical bottleneck lies for the next 2-3 years.

### 5. The Long Game: Marathon, Not Sprint

This competition between the US and China in AI is not a 100-meter dash—it's a marathon lasting decades. And marathons are won by those who pace themselves intelligently and who adjust to new terrain.

**The US has first-mover advantage and capital advantage**. But the US also faces:
- Political cycles that change strategic priorities every 4 years
- Demographic challenges (aging population, lower birthrate)
- Fatigue from 75 years of global dominance spending
- Public weariness with infrastructure spending and national sacrifice

**China has commitment and coordination**. China also benefits from:
- Long-term strategic continuity (not subject to electoral cycles)
- A large and growing working-age population
- The psychological momentum of recent technological catch-up
- An economic system optimized for rapid, large-scale capital deployment

Over a 10-20 year horizon, these structural advantages compound. China doesn't need to win in 2025 or 2026. It needs to win by 2035 or 2040—and that's a very different timeline.

### 6. Which Scenario is Most Likely?

If forced to assess probability, here's the honest view:

- **Scenario 1** (America's AI Century): 25% - Possible if US solves power/permitting issues and maintains capital intensity. But these are non-trivial if statements.
- **Scenario 2** (Chinese Global Leadership): 20% - Would require either export control collapse or major US economic crisis. Possible but not base case.
- **Scenario 3** (US Standard): 15% - Requires both China to fail in compute AND for US to win globally on "trust." The latter is increasingly questionable.
- **Scenario 4** (China's AI+ World): 40% - Most likely. China scales compute steadily, deploys efficiently, and captures enormous market share in cost-sensitive and high-volume segments while competing seriously on frontier models.

**The most probable future is not a clear American victory, but a differentiated duopoly**—with the US dominating in frontier research, large enterprise, and Western alliance markets, while China dominates in deployed AI, emerging markets, and embedded/distributed intelligence.

### 7. Strategic Implications

For China, the takeaway is clear:

1. **Don't abandon the frontier race, but don't bet everything on it**. Continue serious investment in frontier models (Qwen, Ernie, etc.), but recognize that victory in this domain isn't the primary prize.

2. **Dominate the middle market**. Focus relentlessly on the AI applications that affect 90% of economic activity—industrial robotics, agricultural optimization, medical diagnosis, supply chain optimization, financial services. This is where the real value creation happens.

3. **Deploy globally with intent**. Use China's economic relationships and technology partnerships to embed Chinese AI throughout the developing world. Make Chinese AI *indispensable* to the economic functioning of key regions.

4. **Solve the semiconductor problem, but don't panic**. This is a 5-10 year problem with known solutions. Historic state investment will likely bear fruit. In the meantime, source what you can and compensate through software optimization.

5. **Build alliance structures around shared economic interest**. Western countries will exclude China; but most of the world wants technology that works and costs they can afford. That's a coalition worth organizing.

## Final Reflection

The OpenAI analysis is sophisticated and worth studying carefully. But its framing—where the default assumption is that the US *should* maintain global technological leadership—is itself a kind of American exceptionalism.

The world has entered a new era where:
- **No country has hegemonic dominance** across all dimensions of AI
- **Different models and approaches will succeed in different contexts**
- **The narrative of a single "winner" is less relevant** than the narrative of specialization and regional influence

China's path to AI leadership isn't about replicating the American model of frontier research dominance. It's about **redefining what "leadership" means** in a multipolar, fragmented global technology landscape.

If China succeeds—and there's good reason to think it will—it won't be because it built the biggest transformer model. It will be because it built the most widely deployed, most useful, and most accessible AI infrastructure in the world.

That's a different kind of leadership. And it may ultimately prove far more influential than anyone currently imagines.
