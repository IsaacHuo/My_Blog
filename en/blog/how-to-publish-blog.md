# How to Publish a Blog Post on This Website

This guide will walk you through the process of creating and publishing blog posts on this VitePress-based website.

## Prerequisites

Before you start writing, make sure you have:

1. **Node.js** installed on your system
2. **Git** for version control
3. **Basic knowledge** of Markdown syntax
4. **Access** to the repository

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IsaacHuo/My_Blog.git
cd My_Blog
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start a local development server at `http://localhost:5173/My_Blog/`

## Creating a New Blog Post

### 1. Choose the Right Directory

- For English posts: `en/blog/`
- For Chinese posts: `zh/blog/`

### 2. Create Your Markdown File

Create a new `.md` file in the appropriate directory. Use a descriptive filename like `my-awesome-post.md`.

### 3. Add Frontmatter

Every blog post must start with frontmatter that defines metadata:

```yaml

layout: ArticleLayout
title: Your Post Title
date: 2024-01-25
author: Isaac Huo
tags:
  - Tag1
  - Tag2
  - Tag3
description: A brief description of your post
---
```

#### Frontmatter Fields Explained

- **layout**: Always use `ArticleLayout` for blog posts
- **title**: The title of your blog post
- **date**: Publication date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- **author**: Your name
- **tags**: An array of relevant tags
- **description**: A brief summary for SEO and previews

### 4. Write Your Content

After the frontmatter, write your content using Markdown syntax:

```markdown
# Main Heading

Your introduction paragraph goes here.

## Section Heading

### Subsection

Content with **bold text**, *italic text*, and `code snippets`.

```javascript
// Code blocks are supported
function example() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
```

- Bullet points
- Are supported
- As well

1. Numbered lists
2. Work too
3. Perfectly

> Blockquotes are great for highlighting important information.
```

## Markdown Features Supported

### Code Highlighting

Use triple backticks with language specification:

```javascript
const greeting = "Hello, world!";
console.log(greeting);
```

### Tables

| Feature | Supported |
|---------|-----------|
| Tables  | ‚úÖ        |
| Links   | ‚úÖ        |
| Images  | ‚úÖ        |

### Images

```markdown
![Alt text](path/to/image.jpg)
```

Place images in the `public/` directory and reference them like:

```markdown
![My Image](/My_Blog/images/my-image.jpg)
```

### Links

- Internal links: `[About](/en/about)`
- External links: `[GitHub](https://github.com)`

## Table of Contents

The `ArticleLayout` automatically generates a table of contents from your headings. Use proper heading hierarchy (h1, h2, h3, h4) for best results.

## Preview Your Post

While the development server is running, you can preview your post by navigating to:
- `http://localhost:5173/My_Blog/en/blog/your-filename.html`
- `http://localhost:5173/My_Blog/zh/blog/your-filename.html`

## Publishing Process

### 1. Test Locally

Always test your post locally before publishing:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

### 2. Commit Your Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add new blog post: Your Post Title"
```

### 3. Push to Repository

```bash
git push origin main
```

### 4. Deploy

If using GitHub Pages or similar hosting, the site will automatically rebuild and deploy your changes.

## Best Practices

### Writing Tips

1. **Clear Headlines**: Use descriptive, engaging titles
2. **Proper Structure**: Organize content with headings and subheadings
3. **Code Examples**: Include practical examples when discussing technical topics
4. **Consistent Style**: Follow the site's tone and formatting conventions

### SEO Considerations

1. **Meaningful URLs**: Use descriptive filenames
2. **Meta Descriptions**: Write compelling descriptions
3. **Tags**: Use relevant, specific tags
4. **Internal Linking**: Link to related posts when appropriate

### Technical Guidelines

1. **File Naming**: Use lowercase, hyphen-separated names
2. **Image Optimization**: Compress images before uploading
3. **Performance**: Keep posts reasonably sized
4. **Mobile-Friendly**: Test on different screen sizes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Build Errors**
- Check your frontmatter syntax
